# BivMatFun

```BivMatFun``` is a Julia package to evaluate bivariate-matrix functions. 
To install the package into your Julia environment you may run:
```julia
import Pkg;
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/numpi/BivMatFun.git")
```
or, alternatively, enter the ```pkg``` mode by typing ```]```, and then 
running:
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/numpi/BivMatFun.git
```

The function ```fun2m``` can be used to evaluate a bivariate 
matrix function as follows:
```julia
using BivMatFun;
X = fun2m(f, A, B, C)
```
where ```f(x,y,i,j)``` computes the (i,j)-th derivative of the desired
function. Unless the method based on Taylor expansions is specifically
chosen by setting the optional parameter ```method = BivMatFun.Taylor```, 
the ```(i,j)``` parameters can be ignored, as they will always be equal 
to ```(0,0)```Â· 

## Tests

You may run all the tests, which repeat the experiments included in [1].
In order to do that, run the following commands (as above, in `pkg` mode, which can be
enabled by typing `]`):
```julia
pkg> activate .
pkg> test
```
